    <h1>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – 
        could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h1> 
     
 
     <p>
        Information delivery is quick but you miss human interaction.<br>
        Many people can be reached through one click of email but sometimes it is needed to be explained in more detail on different levels, 
        this can cause wrong interpretation of project.<br>
        Work can be done more quickly as in if you are stuck somewhere you can use help through social media site
         but on the other hand there is an equal chance of being getting distracted.

     <p> In terms of Productivity and Effiency
         <ul>
             <li>Improve communications</li>
             <li>Technology can automate process</li>
             <li>Reduce distractions</li>
             <li>Have the right tools and equipment</li>

         </ul>
         
     </p>
     <p>
        Yes, with more knowledge my website would have been more efficient, adding different tags of CSS, 
        my website would have been more creative and more professional.
        With in a team, we could have a different product. Making individual website replicates the knowledge of one person and achievement
         but with in a team you can achieve a bigger project and can learn more. Individual website needs only one person's ideas but with a team you have a mutual consent what to do.
