  <h1>1.0 - Start by writing an ‘about me’ section about your background, why you decided to come to Code Nation and about your experience so far</h1> 
    

    <p>My name is Zahra Ali, I am from Pakistan, did my education there,in computer sciences, moved to UK 12 years ago, spend time raising my beautiful family,
     meanwhile i did a course nvq level2 in teaching assistant,as it fit around school run/routine. But as the family is more settled, 
    I got more time on hand to explore the IT field, I got clueless where to start and one of my friends mentioned “Code Nation”. 
    I came to the open evening, and everything felt making more sense.
    </p>
    
 
 
<p>Being in this 3 week course, I started learning from the very first day, with my instructors Liam and Sam everything looked like a piece of cake. 
    This course is giving me a ray of hope of unlimited possibilities.

       from beginning to end, so that if something goes wrong, we can make comparisons in different code versions and revert to any previous version that we want. 
       It is very much required where multiple developers are continuously working on /changing the source code. It is revision control, source control management. E.g. Git, CVS

        My chosen technologies were understandable and kept me on track. 
        Trello, was a big help as it broke down the tasks into achievable targets. because of trello, I had a clear view where my project is standing, 
        which bit needs help in terms of more time and working. Planning and task organization of Trello is a total game changer.
        
        Git is a tool and GitHub is a service for projects that use Git So, Git is a revision control system, a tool to manage source code history and GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories. Through Git i was able to see the different version of code, 
        i wrote in Visual code Studio, and GitHub held all the information and data regarding it.

<h1>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page </h1>
