        <h1>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website,
             are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello </h1> 
          
      
          <p>Yes, i m pretty happy with the use of VSC, and trello.
            Visual studio code, was easy to use, very understandable for beginners
            It allows you to have a glance at code without opening it as a whole in a separate tab. You can just right click and use inspect function.
            Visual Studio Code has integrated Git control, guaranteeing speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.
            VSC includes debugging tools for Node.js, TypeScript, and JavaScript.
            For a 'wrapped' web-based application, Visual Studio Code performs very well.

            Trello is an excellent organizing  tool. It was easy for me to understand and relatively simple to use.
             As a beginner I was able to track the project using time-tracking tools.
             It was flexible, shareable, and loads of details could be added to one card.

        <h1>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h1>
      
            
          
          <p>I believe the selected tools were appropriate as these tools were quite uncomplicated and straightforward, Visual Studio helped me do basic coding, edit and debug. 
              It highlighted any syntax error, in terms of missing brackets or auto-indentation and many more.
               Trello, made it easy to plan project and in real time, progress can be monitored.  I kept an eye on my progress, 
              by keeping them moving in different tabs to see which bit is still lingering behind.
               Simple in terms of breaking project, and help you see how the project will move on.</p>

      <h1>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not?
           You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change? </h1>
      
        <p>
            I'm happy with the way i have done my website so far,reflecting the knowledge I attained in this course, but i still  have loads more ideas which 
            I can apply and improve the layout of my website.
            I would like to add a navigation bar, to navigate between different tabs.In terms of content, I would do a little more study and get it more informational.

          <p>Outcomes were that I answered all the questions being set in the assignment, develop an understanding of the course.
               using the lessons I managed to make a static website page. 
              I used Visual studio Code and used some styling using CCS.
